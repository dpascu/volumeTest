# Volume Tech Test React Project

## Description
This is the Tech Test for Volume by [Daniel Pascual](https://github.com/dpascu). It contains a website build with React.js using the template [baseReactProject](https://github.com/volumenetwork/baseReactProject). This website displays a video along with your current location weather on the top of it. The position of the weather layer changes every five seconds to avoid screen burn. 
The weather information is fetched from [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/).
Every component and container of this project also has its own test.

Warning: There is a video attached inside the project folder just for testing purposes. If, for any reason, this project is going to be used in production, the video should be removed and hosted in another place.
